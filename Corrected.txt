Then			RB
I			PRP
wondered		VBD
how			WRB
long			RB
I			PRP
had			VBD
to			TO
live			VB
.			.

I			PRP
tried			VBD
to			TO
examine			VB
myself			PRP
.			.

I			PRP
felt			VBD
my			PRP$
pulse			NN
.			.

I			PRP
could			MD
not			RB
at			IN
first			JJ
feel			VB
any			DT
pulse			NN
at			IN
all			DT
.			.

Then			RB
,			,
all			DT
of			IN
a			DT
sudden			JJ
,			,
it			PRP
seemed			VBD
to			TO
start			VB
off			RP
.			.

I			PRP
pulled			VBD
out			IN
my			PRP$
watch			NN
and			CC
timed			VBD
it			PRP
.			.

I			PRP
made			VBD
it			PRP
a			DT
hundred			CD
and			CC
forty-seven		JJR
to			TO
the			DT
minute			NN
.			.

I			PRP
tried			VBD
to			TO
feel			VB
my			PRP$
heart			NN
.			.

I			PRP
could			MD
not			RB
feel			VB
my			PRP$
heart			NN
.			.

It			PRP
had			VBD
stopped			VBN
beating			NN
.			.

I			PRP
have			VBP
since			RB
been			VBN
induced			VBN
to			TO
come			VB
to			TO
the			DT
opinion			NN
that			IN
it			PRP
must			MD
have			VB
been			VBN
there			EX
all			PDT
the			DT
time			NN
,			,
and			CC
must			MD
have			VB
been			VBN
beating			NN
,			,
but			CC
I			PRP
cannot			VBP
account			NN
for			IN
it			PRP
.			.

I			PRP
patted			VBD
myself			PRP
all			RB
over			IN
my			PRP$
front			NN
,			,
from			IN
what			WP
I			PRP
call			VBP
my			PRP$
waist			NN
up			RP
to			TO
my			PRP$
head			NN
,			,
and			CC
I			PRP
went			VBD
a			DT
bit			NN
round			NN
each			DT
side			NN
,			,
and			CC
a			DT
little			JJR
way			NN
up			IN
the			DT
back			NN
.			.

But			CC
I			PRP
could			MD
not			RB
feel			VB
or			CC
hear			VB
anything		NN
.			.

I			PRP
tried			VBD
to			TO
look			VB
at			IN
my			PRP$
tongue			NN
.			.

I			PRP
stuck			VBD
it			PRP
out			RP
as			RB
far			RB
as			IN
ever			RB
it			PRP
would			MD
go			VB
,			,
and			CC
I			PRP
shut			VBD
one			CD
eye			NN
,			,
and			CC
tried			VBD
to			TO
examine			VB
it			PRP
with			IN
the			DT
other			JJ
.			.

I			PRP
could			MD
only			RB
see			VB
the			DT
tip			NN
,			,
and			CC
the			DT
only			JJ
thing			NN
that			WDT
I			PRP
could			MD
gain			VB
from			IN
that			WDT
was			VBD
to			TO
feel			VB
more			JJR
certain			JJ
than			IN
before			RB
that			IN
